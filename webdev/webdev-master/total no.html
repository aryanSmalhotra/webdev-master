                <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup
                    language for
                    documents designed to be displayed in
                    a web
                    browser.</p>

                <p>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such
                    as
                    JavaScript.</p>

                <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                    into
                    multimedia web
                    pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
                    appearance
                    of the
                    document.</p>

                <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
                    such as
                    interactive
                    forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
                    by
                    denoting
                    structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
                    HTML
                    elements
                    are
                    delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. </p>

                <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the
                    behavior and
                    content
                    of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.</p>
                n 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for
                CERN
                researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
                hypertext
                system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
                Berners-Lee
                and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the
                project was
                not
                formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in
                which
                hypertext
                is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

                The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on
                the
                Internet
                by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
                simple design
                of
                HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard
                Generalized
                Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML
                4.[8]

                <p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other
                    material
                    into
                    visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in
                    the
                    browser,
                    and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of
                    CSS.</p>

                n 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for
                CERN
                researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
                hypertext
                system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
                Berners-Lee
                and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the
                project was
                not
                formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in
                which
                hypertext
                is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

                The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on
                the
                Internet
                by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
                simple design
                of
                HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard
                Generalized
                Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML
                4.[8]

                <p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other
                    material
                    into
                    visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in
                    the
                    browser,
                    and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of
                    CSS.</p>
