    </p>

    <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup
        language for
        documents designed to be displayed in
        a web
        browser.</p>

    <p>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web
        pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
        appearance
        of the
        document.</p>

    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive
        forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
        denoting
        structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
        elements
        are
        delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. </p>

    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content
        of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.</p>
    n 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
    researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
    system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
    Berners-Lee
    and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was
    not
    formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which
    hypertext
    is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

    The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the
    Internet
    by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design
    of
    HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized
    Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]

    <p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material
        into
        visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the
        browser,
        and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS.</p>
